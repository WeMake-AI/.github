# Company Handbook

Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This handbook explains how we work. It is a tool for clarity, not a collection of rules to be memorized.

<summary>1. Why WeMake Exists</summary>

## Why WeMake Exists

### Our Mission

We transform organizations with responsible AI. The objective is to enable people to have more impact, make work more
meaningful, and help companies learn faster. We build solutions for actual problems: operational, strategic, and human.
Our approach is German-first in quality, ethics, security, and languageâ€”globally aware, but with a precise understanding
of the local context.

#### A Few Axioms

- **Work is a practice.** Good work requires a principled stance, craftsmanship, and robust systems.
- **Technology is not an end in itself.** It is an amplifier of intent. Useful if the direction is sound, dangerous if
  it is not.
- **Responsibility is not a buzzword.** It is a daily, operational decision, visible in our code, contracts, consulting,
  and support.
- **We measure ourselves by impact.** What is demonstrably better after 30, 90, and 365 days? For users, teams, clients,
  and society.

#### You Are Capable of More Than One Solution

Our operating assumption is that people are capable of more than typical job descriptions permit. Consequently, we
design work to enable you to create multiple solutions, not just single features. This includes:

- Broad ownership (Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Operation â†’ Learning).
- Access to our "infrastructure of competence" (Clarity, V41).
- Coaching, documentation, and feedback loops.
- Clear, publicly traceable decisions (PRs, RFCs, Architecture Decision Records).
- Tools that get out of the way instead of complicating work.

### Our Strategy

#### 1. Be the Source of Truth for Client and AI Solutions

- We connect strategic consulting with executable technology.
- Clarity is our organizational intelligence layer; V41 is the multimodal foundation.
- Our consulting is not separate from the productâ€”it operationalizes our mission, ethics, and architecture.

#### 2. Offer Every Solution Needed to Help Companies Grow

- We build, curate, and orchestrate solutions along real value streams: sales, operations, support, compliance, product,
  people.
- Our toolbox (Clarity/V41) enables specific, repeatable solutionsâ€”industry-aligned but not hardened into bespoke dead
  ends.

#### 3. Be First to Learn

- We prioritize Time-to-Learn over Time-to-Launch. We favor rapid, valid learning cycles over "perfect" roadmaps.
- Our default is to build iteratively in public: changelogs, demo environments, open docs, public discussions.

### The "Secret" Master Plan

The only secret here is the irony. The plan is public.

- **Today (Current State):** Consulting, orchestration, and implementation with Clarity/V41; productive deployments;
  transparent guidelines.
- **Next 12â€“24 Months (Target State):** More self-serve capabilities, smarter automation patterns, intensive readiness
  checks, a broader library of reusable solutions; expansion of our German language and cultural competence in models.
- **Long-Term:** WeMake as the reference for responsible, effective AI in the German-speaking world; an infrastructure
  provider, not a project shop.

<summary>2. How We Got Here</summary>

## How We Got Here

Influences that have shaped our thinking.

### Books (As a Type, Not a Checklist)

- Systems thinking, antifragile organizations, ethics in technology, humans in complex systems.
- Practices: RFCs, Design Docs, Postmortems, operational learning, decision journals.
- Stance: Clarity, courage, consequence.

### Other Companies (As Learning Environments)

- Open-source communities (governance, reviews, contribution culture).
- Security and cloud pioneers (Zero Trust, resilience, automation).
- Product teams that treat documentation as a product.

### This Handbook (As a Tool)

- This handbook is alive. We commit to it. We version it. We review it.
- It exists not to be right, but to become better.
- If reality and the handbook diverge, reality winsâ€”and we update the handbook.

### Defining Analogies (Brief and Honest)

- **Open Source â†’ Our Operating Model:** Public, traceable, contributions welcome.
- **Urban Infrastructure â†’ Our Platform Strategy:** Clarity/V41 are the roads, power, and water. Products are built upon
  them.
- **A Gym, Not a Spa â†’ Our Culture:** You are here to train your capacity for responsibility and skill. Comfort is a
  byproduct, not the goal.

<summary>3. How We Acquire Users</summary>

## How We Acquire Users

### Why We Are the Way We Are

- We solve real problems, not hypothetical ones.
- We speak our users' language (literally: German; professionally: the language of their domain).
- Trust is our currency, earned through transparency, security, and clear expectations.

### For Us, Marketing Is Creating Useful Things

- Content is our marketing. From deep dives to practical guides.
- We do not offer "Hype as a Service." We explain how things workâ€”and how they fail.
- We share what we learn: benchmarks, metrics, trade-offs, decisions, and their costs.

### We Invest Heavily in Our Website

- The website is a product. It is the first experience of WeMake.
- It enables self-service: demos, docs, sandboxes, direct sign-upsâ€”ideally without a sales call.
- It is fast, accessible, searchable, understandable, and current.
- It states what we do and, just as importantly, what we do not do.

### We Make It Extremely Easy to Buy WeMake Solutions

- Freemium/trials, clear usage models, simple contracts.
- Shortcuts, not hurdles: direct purchase, pilots, pay-as-you-go.
- No hidden fees. Pricing is explained, not obfuscated.

<summary>4. Who We Build For</summary>

## Who We Build For

### Our Current ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

- Organizations in the DACH region with high standards for quality, security, and ethics.
- Teams prepared to work with AI operationally, not just discuss it.
- Regulated domains: healthcare, finance, industry, public sector, educationâ€”where diligence is mandatory.
- People who take equality, empowerment, and purpose seriously and are willing to accept the consequences (ownership,
  learning curves, feedback).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Who should we think about most when creating?

- The practitioner: the person who runs the process, who deals with the error, who actually saves or loses time.
- Leaders responsible for impact, not just spreadsheets.
- Colleagues who will join later. Documentation is a welcome package.

#### What is a high-potential customer and why does it matter?

- **High-potential:** Clear pain points, data access, operational readiness, a sponsor with ownership.
- **Why it matters:** We want results. This means fast learning cycles, repeatable patterns, and scalable solutions.

#### What is a hobbyist and why does it matter?

- **Hobbyist:** Someone who experiments without a real-world application or commitment.
- **Why it matters:** We are helpful but focused. We assist where we can, but we prioritize impact.

#### Why the AI team?

- Because execution matters: data, processes, security, governance, integration.
- The AI team ensures repeatable quality, not just colorful demos.

#### What about marketing?

- Marketing is part of the product: content, demos, documentation, community.
- Its goal is to enable understanding and lower barriers.
- Sales is consulting, not pressure.

<summary>5. How We Make Users Happy</summary>

## How We Make Users Happy

The term "happy" is imprecise. We aim for "effective," "capable," and "confident." Happiness is a potential outcome.

### Creating Solutions People Actually Want

- We start with the job-to-be-done, not the feature list.
- We measure impact: time saved, error reduction, quality improvements, user satisfaction.
- We build small and learn fast: Proof â†’ Pilot â†’ Production.
- We document what we learnâ€”publicly, when possible.

### Experts Talk to Users and Provide Support

- There is no scripted support queue. You speak with the people who built the solution.
- Review and support calls are short, specific, and solution-oriented. We are async-first and document everything for
  traceability.
- We are honest about trade-offs and help you make the right decision for your context.

<summary>6. How We Make Money</summary>

## How We Make Money

### Our Sales Approach Is Based on the Best Experience for Our ICP

- Self-serve and low-touch where possible. High-touch only where necessary.
- Content, demos, and readiness checks lower acquisition costs and increase customer fit.
- We do not sell hypotheticals. Our solutions are usable, not just presentable.

### Price Should Not Be an Obstacle

- Transparent models. Low-friction entry points.
- We prioritize utility over margin maximization. This is sustainable, not naive.
- We invest in efficiency and automation to keep prices low over the long term.

### Billing Based on Actual Usage with Full User Control

- Pay-as-you-go, caps, limits, and alerts. You control your costs.
- Data and metric exportability is a standard feature, not a premium one.
- Canceling is as easy as signing up.

### Be the Most Economical Option for Any Given Solution

- We optimize for Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which includes implementation, operation, and risk.
- If an open-source alternative is cheaper and sufficient, we will recommend itâ€”even at the cost of short-term revenue.
- We earn trust before we maximize revenue.

### Principles for Enterprise Engagements

- It is acceptable to lose deals if it means adhering to our principles.
- We do not commit to specific deliverables in contracts; we commit to outcomes against defined goals and metrics.
- We build things when we are convinced they can be used by more than one organization.
- Clients must try solutions before requesting changes. Learning beats hypothesizing.
- Product Management/CSM is not a default role, but a lightweight, temporary tool we deploy when scale, coordination, or
  compliance requires it.
- Security and ethics are non-negotiable.

<summary>7. Sustaining Low Prices</summary>

## Sustaining Low Prices

### We Can Sell Multiple Products to the Same People

- Problems rarely exist in isolation. A customer with one solved problem often has another. We deliver modular,
  integrable solutions.
- Cross-solution design saves implementation costs.

### No Traditional Sales Team Required

- Documentation, demos, sandboxes, and online purchasing lower the barriers to entry, allowing you to decide for
  yourself.
- Sales is a consultative function, not a persuasive one.

### Multiple Solutions, One Data Plane

- Clarity as the orchestrator, V41 as the core. This provides unified identities, metrics, and governance.
- Less integration, fewer data silos, lower costs.

### A Technical Audience That Needs Documentation, Not Technical Support

- We write docs that are actually helpful: how-tos, playbooks, architectural diagrams, decision guides.
- We invest in examples, SDKs, and templates to prevent support tickets.

### Use of Open-Source Technology

- We use what is effective and contribute back where we can.
- Open source is also a governance model: public, reviewable, forkable.

<summary>8. Deciding on New Solutions</summary>

## Deciding on New Solutions

### How We Select Features Within Existing Solutions

- **Guiding Question:** Whose problem are we solving, and how quickly can we learn from it?
- **Criteria:** Utility, reusability, security, complexity, maintenance load, documentability.
- **Formats:** RFCs, Architecture Decision Records, small experiments, public changelogs.

### How We Select New Solutions

- We create a new solution when a problem cannot be logically integrated into an existing one, or when a new bundle of
  capabilities emerges.
- We avoid creating a product graveyard. Every solution has a clear owner, clear metrics, and clear exit criteria.
- Before we build, we write the documentation we will need later: installation, runbooks, troubleshooting, security,
  ethics, metrics.

<summary>9. A Broad Company with Small Teams</summary>

## A Broad Company with Small Teams

### Speed

- Speed is a function of small batch sizes, clear responsibilities, and publicly traceable decisions.
- We optimize for throughput and learning velocity, not for resource utilization.

### Small Teams

- Small, autonomous cells with end-to-end responsibility.
- Teams have what they need or they build it. We minimize dependencies.

### Minimal Hierarchy

- Leadership is an activity, not a rank.
- We lead through clarity, not control.

### Titles Based on Your Actual Work

- Your title should reflect your output, not your aspiration.
- Career paths are built on expanding competence, not climbing a ladder.

### Goal Setting

- We use clear, measurable goals with tight feedback loops.
- "Ship small, learn big": small releases, large learning effects.

- We activate Product Management/CSM as a lightweight, temporary function where enterprise context, coordination, or
  compliance demands it.
- The goal: Fewer layers of translation, more shared understanding, faster learning loops.

### Transparency Fuels Autonomy

- Every significant decision has a corresponding PR, issue, or ADR.
- Minutes, postmortems, and metrics are standard practice.
- Security and ethics are documented alongside functionality.

### It Starts with Hiring

</details>
<br/>
<details>

<summary>14. Where We Are Going</summary>

## Where We Are Going

### Will WeMake Be Sold?

- We are building for independence. A sale is not a goal, but a possible eventâ€”if it strengthens the mission and its
  people.
- We prefer secondary sales to full acquisitions.

### â‚¬1M ARR by 2027

- A specific, measurable goal. This represents recurring value and impact, not just revenue.
- We will publish key metrics that illustrate the journey (without sharing confidential information).

### Secondary Sales Over a Full Acquisition

- Employees should have the opportunity to realize value without selling the culture or mission.
- We prefer options that secure stability while enabling growth.

</details>
<br/>
<details>

<summary>15. How You Can Help</summary>

## How You Can Help

### Onboard Quickly

- Read this handbook and our core documents.
- Start with a small, useful contribution: improve a piece of documentation, write a small script, add a test, define a
  pattern.

### Ask for Help, But Only After You Have Tried

- Show your work: what you did, what you observed, what failed.
- Ask specific questions so we can provide specific help.

### Do Not Expect Perfection

- "Perfect" is often slow and fragile. "Clear, functional, and documented" is our target state.
- Mistakes are acceptable; hiding them is not.

### Make It Better

- Leave everything a bit clearer, simpler, and more secure than you found it.
- Write the documentation you wish you had when you started.

### Don't Wait for Others

- Ownership means taking action. Get context, decide, document, iterate.
- If you are blocked, state it early.

### Have an Opinion

- Say what you thinkâ€”reasoned, respectful, and with a willingness to be wrong.
- If you change your mind, document why.

### Think Around Corners

- Look for the third, fourth, and fifth solution patterns.
- Combine existing components in new ways. Clarity AI is designed for this.

### Don't Assign Issues to People

- We work in teams. Issues describe problems; teams commit to solutions.
- Responsibilities are clear but not personified in the tracking system.

### Don't Merge Without a Review

- A minimum of one review for code, docs, and decisions.
- A review is about sharing responsibility, not bureaucracy.

### PRs > Issues > Slack

- Decisions and changeable proposals belong in Pull Requests.
- Ideas and problems belong in Issues.
- Slack is for coordination and human connection.
- If it is important, it does not live only in Slack.

### Make Things Public by Default

- Public is the default; confidential requires justification.
- Write for a future reader: be brief, clear, and provide links.

### Be Proactive with Community Questions

- Answer in a way that is helpful, friendly, and honest.
- If you don't know the answer, say so, and then find it.

### And If You Don't Work Here

- You are free to read, cite, and critique this handbook.
- If you believe something is missing or incorrect, open an issue. We would be grateful.
